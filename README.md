# PersoFile â€” Simple smartcard interaction example

This repository contains a minimal Java example that demonstrates how to interact with specific smartcards using the javax.smartcardio API.

Key code:
- Main example: [`PersoFile`](src/main/java/PersoFile.java)
- Important methods:
  - [`PersoFile.selectFile`](src/main/java/PersoFile.java)
  - [`PersoFile.readFile`](src/main/java/PersoFile.java)
  - [`PersoFile.readPerso`](src/main/java/PersoFile.java)
  - [`PersoFile.readCert`](src/main/java/PersoFile.java)

Overview
- Scans all available card terminals and connects to any present card.
- Matches card ATRs for known card types (IDEMIA Cosmo 8.1, 8.2, X / Thales IAS Classic v5.2.1).
- Selects applets and files (AID/DF/EF) and reads:
  - Document number (printed as UTF-8)
  - Perso file rows (printed as UTF-8)
  - Auth and Sign certificates (printed as hex)

Prerequisites
- Java 17 (configured in [build.gradle](build.gradle))
- A smartcard reader and a supported smartcard inserted
- Permission to access the smartcard reader on your OS

Build and run
- Use the included wrapper:
  - Unix/macOS: ./gradlew build
  - Windows: gradlew.bat build
- Run the jar:
  - java -jar build/libs/*.jar
- Or run from an IDE using the `PersoFile` main class.

Other files
- Gradle wrapper scripts: [gradlew](gradlew), [gradlew.bat](gradlew.bat)
- Wrapper properties: [gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties](gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties)
- Jar manifest used by the build: [build/tmp/jar/MANIFEST.MF](build/tmp/jar/MANIFEST.MF)

Notes
- This is an example for demonstration and debugging only. Use caution when accessing or modifying smartcard data.
- If no card is detected, nothing will be printed.
